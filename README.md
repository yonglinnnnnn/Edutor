With Covid-19’s restrictions and safety precautions these days, many tutors are unable to have one on one effective sessions with students for lessons and teachings. Students fall behind as they cannot have immediate sessions for guidance and help for their works.

Our platform seeks to provide a safe learning platform for both students and tutors, creating a conducive learning environment using different lesson packages that can be purchased and one-on-one sessions that can be booked with tutors for the students’ learning needs.
